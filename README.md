## About

Currently, I am working on a Fullstack project using Next.js, which aims to create a Single Page Application (SPA) for a hairdresser salon with a booking visit system. The project is named "HairdresserSPA" and is not intended for commercial purposes; it serves purely as a practice Next.js app using the router directory structure.

As of now, the project is in its development phase, and I am actively using Git issues as a dashboard to manage new feature ideas, track bugs, and plan improvements. While progress is being made, please note that not all comments have been removed from the code, and some components are yet to be clearly split into smaller, manageable parts.

I'm excited to announce that soon, the project will reach version 1.0.0, and it will be made available to the public. Stay tuned for updates on its release!

To check out the current Live version 0.1.0, you can visit: https://hairdresser-page.vercel.app/

(Note: The given link is for version 0.1.0 of the project. Please look forward to the upcoming version 1.0.0, which will bring more features and improvements.)
